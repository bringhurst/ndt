 			I2 Utility library. Currently contains:
 				* error logging
 				* command-line parsing
				* threading

The error logging and command-line parsing are taken from a utility library
that is distributed with the "volsh" code from UCAR.

        http://www.scd.ucar.edu/vets/vg/Software/volsh

I have used this in the past - and it seemed silly not to use it since it
is freely distributed.
