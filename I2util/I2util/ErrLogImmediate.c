/*
 * Function:	I2ErrLogImmediate()
 *
 * Description:	The I2ErrLogImmediate() function is a client logging function
 *		that may be passed to I2OpenErr() as the `log_func' argument.
 *
 *		Upon invocation, I2ErrLogImmediate() writes a logging message
 *		via a call to fprintf(). The behavior of I2ErrLogImmediate()
 *		may be controlled by the structure pointed to by `arg'. The
 *		members of the structure pointed to by `arg' that may be
 *		set include:
 *
 *			*fp		A file pointer passed to be passed to 
 *					fprintf()
 *
 *			line_info	A bit mask indicating how each output
 *					line should be formatted. The mask
 *					is a bitwise inclusive OR of the
 *					valid attribute bits. If line_info
 *					is zero nothing is printed.
 *
 *			tformat		A format string as defined by
 *					strftime used to format the local
 *					time if the `line_info' attribute
 *					I2RTIME is set.
 *
 *		Valid attribute mask bits include:
 *
 *			I2NAME	
 *			I2FILE
 *			I2LINE
 *			I2DATE
 *			I2RTIME
 *			I2MSG
 *
 *		If I2NAME is set `ev->name', followed by a ":" is 
 *		copied to `arg->fp'.
 *
 *		If I2FILE is set the string "FILE=", followed by 
 *		`ev->file', followed by ",", followed by a space is copied 
 *		to `arg->fp'.
 *
 *		If I2LINE is set the string "LINE=", followed by the ascii
 *		representation of `ev->line', followed by ",", followed by 
 *		a space is copied to `arg->fp'.
 *
 *		If I2DATE is set the string "DATE=", followed by 
 *		`ev->date', followed by ",", followed by a space is copied 
 *		to `arg->fp'.
 *
 *		If I2RTIME is set the string "RTIME=", followed by 
 *		`time', followed by ",", followed by a space is copied 
 *		to `arg->fp', where `time' is string formatted by
 *		arg->tformat.
 *	
 *		If I2MSG is set `ev->msg' is copied to `arg->fp.
 *
 *		Finally, a trailing newline is copied to `arg->fp'
 *
 *
 * In Args:
 *
 *	*arg	A pointer to a I2LogImmediateAttr structure.
 *
 * Out Args:
 *
 * Return Values:
 *
 * Side Effects:
